This is a Recipe App, that will allow for quick retrieval, editing and grouping of recipies. There are two api calls, one for the images, and another to retrieve the recipe. You can also save recipies and groups of recipies to your profile. Below are some of the tasks you can perform with the Recipe App. 

* Search Recipe
* Edit Recipe
* Suprise Me
* Add to Deck
* Add to Group
* Sign Up
* Log in


<a name="SearchRecipe"></a>### Searching Recipie

### Add to Deck

Add to Deck gives you the ability to save recipe to the bottom of your deck, to be able to be easily retrieved at a later point in time. Below is an example of this functionality:
